My variation of thoughtbot's laptop script to install necessary software on a new machine.


For now you have to install homebrew first. "**soon to be fixed**"

Edit **install_me** to add brews/casks that you wish to install and run the script

Use cask's full name to prevent collision eg
Caskroom/cask/dash instead of just "dash"

**assets/** contains
* zsh theme config
* Terminal theme (Flat)
* snippets (opinionated settings or just remarks)
